# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose:
The purpose of this activity was to use unsupervised learning to group different cryptocurrencies together based on various factors. 


## Summary:
After preprocessing the data, reducing the dimensions using PCA, and clustering the data using K-means, the data was plotted onto a table using hvplot. The data was also placed on a scatterplot that showed total coins mined vs total coin supply, with each data point being colored to represent the classification it was given.
